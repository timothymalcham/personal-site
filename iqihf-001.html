  <h1 class="title">Interview Questions I've Failed, 001 (JavaScript Scope)</h1>

  <p>
    I'm writing a series of posts on questions I've been asked during interviews
    that I did not answer correctly, or I may have stumbled through the question
    without having a full understanding of the answer. I'll be reviewing the
    question asked and provide the correct answering and why that answer is the
    correct one. My hope is to have a deeper understanding of the concept the
    interview question was based around, and maybe help someone else out.
  </p>
  <p>
    This first question isn't one I really 'failed', per se. I got through about
    75% of the question and tripped over a few parts of it. The question was all
    about scope in JavaScript, which is super important to have a solid grasp of
    if you write JavaScript regurarly, so I wanted to go back and make sure I really
    understood each part of the question well.
  </p>

  <p class="title">The Question:</p>

  <p>
    Given this block of code, when it is run, what will each <code>console.log</code>
    statement print out?
  </p>

  <pre><code data-language="javascript">(function() {

  var x = 1;

  function test() {
    console.log('First log statement: ', x);
    x = 2;
  }

  (function(x) {
    x = 3;
    console.log('Second log statement:', x);
    test();
    console.log('Third log statement:', x);
  }(x));

  console.log('Fourth log statement:', x);

  (function() {
    console.log('Fifth log statement:', x);
    var x = 4;
    console.log('Sixth log statement:', x);
  }());

  console.log('Seventh log statement:', x);

}());</code></pre>

  <p>
    If you run this code in your browser's developer tools console, you will get
    this output:
  </p>

  <code><pre>
  Second log statement: 3
  First log statement: 1
  Third log statement: 3
  Fourth log statement: 2
  Fifth log statement: undefined
  Sixth log statement: 4
  Seventh log statement: 2</pre></code>

  <p>
    Let’s go through this line by line and learn why we get this output.
  </p>

  <p>
    One note before we get started talking about scope. You might notice that
    some of the above functions look a bit strange, like this:
  </p>

  <pre><code data-language="javascript">(function(x) {
  // function code goes here…
}(x));</code></pre>

  <p>
    These are Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs. They're a bit
    self explanatory, they are functions that run (get invoked) immediately as
    soon as the parser reaches it when your program is getting executed. This
    unlike a function that gets declared and then called later on. Both happens at
    the same time with IIFEs. But like other ways of creating a function, IIFEs
    still create a new execution context, which defines a scope for variables
    and other functions to live in.
  </p>
