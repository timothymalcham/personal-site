  <h1 class="title">Interview Questions I've Failed, 004: Linked List</h1>

  <p>
    I've never actually failed to implement a linked list during a technical
    interview, mostly because I've never been asked to. So in the post I'll be
    going through the coding of a linked list just in case it ever comes up, as
    it is a fairly standard data structure. This will be a singly linked list,
    not a double.
  </p>

  <p>
    A linked list is a standard data structure – a list made up of individual nodes,
    and in the case of a singly linked list, each node has a "pointer" that points
    to the node behind it. The first node in the list is the "head" and the last
    node is the "tail".
  </p>

  <pre>
    (head) -> (node) -> (node) -> (node) -> (tail)</pre>
