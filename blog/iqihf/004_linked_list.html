  <h1 class="title">Interview Questions I've Failed, 004: Linked List</h1>

  <p>
    I've never actually failed to implement a linked list during a technical
    interview, mostly because I've never been asked to. So in the post I'll be
    going through the coding of a linked list just in case it ever comes up, as
    it is a fairly standard data structure. This will be a singly linked list,
    not a double.
  </p>

  <p>
    A linked list is a standard data structure – a list made up of individual nodes,
    and in the case of a singly linked list, each node has a "pointer" that points
    to the node behind it. The first node in the list is the "head" and the last
    node is the "tail".
  </p>

  <pre>
    (head) -> (node) -> (node) -> (node) -> (tail)</pre>

  <p>
    Let's see what a linked list looks like when outputted to a console.
  </p>

  <pre><code data-language="javascript">let list = new LinkedList();
list.add(1)
list.add(2)
list.add(3)
console.log(list)</code></pre>

  <p>
    After running those lines of code this is what we would get:
  </p>

  <pre><code data-language="javascript">{
  length: 0,
  head: {
    data: 1,
    next: {
      data: 2,
      next: {
        data: 3,
        next: null
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

  <p>
    Basically just a bunch of nested objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's an implementation that we'll walk through.
  </p>

  <pre><code data-language="javascript">class LinkedList {

  constructor() {
    // we start with an empty list
    this.length = 0;
    // since there are no nodes, there is no head
    this.head = null;
  }

  // our first method will allow us to add new nodes to the list
  // We pass in the data we want to store in the list as an argument
  add(data) {
    // we create the node here
    const node = {
      data,
      next: null
    };

    // we create a variable that will help traverse the list
    let current;

    // first we need to check if the list is empty or not.
    // The first time around, the list will be empty.

    if (this.head === null) {
      // if the list is empty, make the newly created node the head
      this.head = node;
    } else {
      // otherwise, we need to traverse the list, get to the end,
      // and then attach the newly created node to it.

      // to start traversing, let's start at the beginning of
      // the list, the head.
      current = this.head;

      while (current.next) {
        // as long as nodes are pointing to something behind them,
        // we need to be traversing.
        current = current.next;
      }

      // Once we've reach the end, we attach the newly created node,
      // behind the currently last node.
      current.next = node;

      this.length++;

    }

  }
}</code></pre>
