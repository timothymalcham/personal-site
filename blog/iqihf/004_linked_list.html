  <h1 class="title">Interview Questions I've Failed, 004: Linked List</h1>

  <p>
    I've never actually failed to implement a linked list during a technical
    interview, mostly because I've never been asked to. So in the post I'll be
    going through the coding of a linked list just in case it ever comes up, as
    it is a fairly standard data structure.
